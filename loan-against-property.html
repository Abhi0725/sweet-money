	    <p>It is a secured loan. The ROI (Rate of Interest) of LAP is lesser than Business Loan or personel Loan. This loan can be used anywhere like Business, Marriage or investing in a stock. The tenure of LAP is also higher than any other loan like business loan/ personel loan.  </p>
		
		<ul style="padding-left:30px;">
		 <li style="font-weight:bold">LAP on residential property:-</li>
		     <p>LAP can be taken against residential property. Bank can normally take 65%-70% LTV on this product. We also provide LAP on colonies. But all the property papers should be there. And no-doubt, Re-payment elgiblity should be there.</p>
		 <li style="font-weight:bold">LAP on commercial property:-</li>
		     <p>It is looking like similar to above point. The meaning of commercial property is shop, office, hotel, restaurent. The maximum loan can be given 55%-65% of the market value.</p>
		 <li style="font-weight:bold">Loan Against Property Balance Transfer:-</li>
		     <p>If one thinks they are re-paying their LAP on higher rate of interest then we can tranfer their loan to another Bank with the lower rate of interest facility.</p>
		 <li style="font-weight:bold">Loan Against Property lease rental discounting:-</li>
		     <p>If client is getting rent in thier account we can consider that rent as their income. Client can take LAP with their rental income also.</p>
		 <li style="font-weight:bold">Loan Against Property for Negative Areas/Colonies:-</li>
		     <p>It is very hard thought to take loan with offering colony/negative area property. In the view of bank those properties are called negative area where bank don't get any sanction plan. But Sweet Money now the problem has been solved. We can provide LAP on negative area/ Colony  with the condition that all the property papers should be there plus income eligiblity.</p>
